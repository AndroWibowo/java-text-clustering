                      The Canadian parliament has begun debate on a no-confidence motion expected to topple the Conservative minority government.
        Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff said Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#039;s government &quot;breaks the rules&quot; and &quot;does not deserve to remain in office&quot;.
        If the motion passes on Friday, it will trigger an election in early May.
        The vote stems from a ruling on Monday that the Conservative government was in contempt of parliament.
        A parliamentary committee judged that Mr Harper&#039;s government had acted in contempt by failing to disclose the full costs of spending on programmes involving tougher crime legislation, corporate tax cuts and plans to purchase stealth fighter jets.
        &#039;Reckless actions&#039;
        &quot;The House must speak with a clear voice and it must say that a government that breaks the rules and conceals the facts from the Canadian people does not deserve to remain in office,&quot; Mr Ignatieff said.
        Conservative House of Commons leader John Baird spoke on behalf of the Conservative Party ahead of the confidence vote.
        &quot;I&#039;m saddened that a parliament which has accomplished a lot recently will come to an end because of the reckless actions of the [opposition]... in forcing an unwanted and unnecessary election on Canadians,&quot; he told legislators.
        Mr Baird warned a vote of no-confidence in the government would &quot;weaken Canada&#039;s economic recovery&quot;.
        Also at issue is the Conservative government&#039;s budget plan, which it unveiled on Tuesday and which was immediately rejected by the three opposition parties.
        With four parties holding seats in the House of Commons - the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois in addition to the Liberals and Conservatives - it is difficult for a single party to gain a majority.
        The Conservatives came to power in 2006 but need opposition support in order to pass any legislation.
        Recent polls suggest the Conservative party will retain power in a May election, although not necessarily win enough seats to take the majority.
