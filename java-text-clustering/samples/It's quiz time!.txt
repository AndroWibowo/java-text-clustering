	Answers
	
	
		It was Leonardo DiCaprio in May 2007. Knut was photographed separately and superimposed on a shot of DiCaprio in Iceland. Two months earlier he had had the entire cover of German Vanity Fair all to himself.
	
		It's Mexico. The manual advises Mexican government workers to avoid comments that enforce gender stereotypes, as well as the default use of the masculine form in the Spanish language. The phrases it warns against  include: "If you want to work, why did you have children?" and "You're prettier when you keep quiet".
	
		It's Boliva, which has said it will take Chile to international courts to try to recover access to the Pacific Ocean, which it lost in a war more than a century ago. The landlocked Andean nation maintains a small navy, and schoolchildren are taught that regaining access to the sea is a patriotic duty.
	
		It's a VW Camper Van. Novelist and screen writer Frank Cottrell Boyce was asked by the family of original creator Ian Fleming to pen a sequel.
	
		It's a dry wind. Both the UK and US military say the names they have chosen - ELLAMY and Odyssey Dawn - are meaningless. Canada has chosen a name that begins with "m" - MOBILE - because the operation is being conducted in part in the Mediterranean.
	
		It's the bootstraps. "The figure tries to recreate the Pre-Columbian features of the Maya region in southeastern Mexico, but the height, the posture and the flexed legs and the boot straps are not characteristic of this culture," a spokesman from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History said.
	
		It was Canada. The pair married in Montreal but because Quebec had no civil marriage at the time, the ceremony was conducted by Rev Leonard Mason of what was then known as the Unitarian Church of the Messiah. Both Taylor and Burton had just obtained divorces in Mexico, because at the time the US did not have liberal divorce laws.
