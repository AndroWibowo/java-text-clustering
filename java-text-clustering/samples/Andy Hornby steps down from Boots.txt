                      Andy Hornby, the man in charge of HBOS bank when it was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group, has resigned as chief executive of Alliance Boots.
        After what Mr Hornby called &quot;an intense five years&quot; as boss of first HBOS and then Boots, he said he had decided to take &quot;a few months&#039; break&quot;.
        Boots said it would begin its search for a successor &quot;in due course&quot;.
        The chairman of the group, Stefano Pessina, praised Mr Hornby&#039;s &quot;wealth of retail and marketing experience&quot;.
  Growing revenue
	      &quot;I have thoroughly enjoyed the last couple of years at Alliance Boots, during which time the company has performed very well,&quot; said My Hornby, who had been in the job less than two years.
        &quot;I am confident that Alliance Boots will continue to go from strength to strength under the leadership of Stefano Pessina and the executive team.&quot;
        In the first half of the current financial year, Boots posted a 6% rise in revenues to £8.9bn.
        Alliance Boots was bought by private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for £11bn in 2007. Boots and Alliance Unichem had merged a year earlier.
        The Nottingham-based firm has more than 3,000 stores worldwide and employs over 115,000 people, including about 70,000 in the UK.
