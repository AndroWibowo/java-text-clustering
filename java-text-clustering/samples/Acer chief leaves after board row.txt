The chief executive of Acer, one of the world's biggest computer makers, has resigned after falling out with the company's board. 

Acer said Gianfranco Lanci disagreed with the majority of the board over what should be the future priorities for the business. 

They had failed to reach agreement, even after several months of discussions, the netbook maker added.

Chairman JT Wang will take on the chief executive's role temporarily.

"The personal computer remains the core of our business," said Mr Wang in an official statement from the company that acknowledged his differences with the outgoing chief executive.

As well as continued growth in the PC segment, the chairman said Acer would be "stepping into the new mobile device market, where we will invest cautiously and aim to become one of the leading players".

Mr Lanci, who had been chief executive since 2008, was a major proponent of expanding into the mobile and tablet computer business lines.

The growth in personal computer sales has been hit by the popularity of new tablets such as the Apple iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab.  

The Taiwanese company said last week that its revenues had fallen 10% in the first quarter - much worse than the 3% drop originally forecast - due to weaker demand in the US and Europe.

Acer's shares have dropped 18% in the four trading sessions since then.

Acer started selling its first tablet PCs last month and is expected to launch several new models in the coming months.
