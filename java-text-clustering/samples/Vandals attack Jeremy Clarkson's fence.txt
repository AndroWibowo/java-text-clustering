Vandals have uprooted fence posts and a gate near the Isle of Man home of Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

The posts were then thrown from the cliff on to rocks below the beauty spot of Langness.

Wire fencing has also been cut away from around the perimeter of Mr Clarkson's holiday home.

The peninsula became the subject of controversy after ramblers complained Mr Clarkson had diverted a footpath.

He claimed there had never been any public right of way across the land. 

The row is currently being dealt with by the High Court and no final ruling has been made.

Anyone with information to help the police is advised to contact the southern neighbourhood policing team.
