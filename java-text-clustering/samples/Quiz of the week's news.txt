	Answers
	
	
		It's number four, which is a Ford Focus. In announcing a cut in fuel duty, Mr Osborne said the cost of filling a Focus had risen by £10. One paper dubbed it the "Ford Focus Budget". Picture one is a Mondeo, two is a Ka and three a Fiesta.
	
		It's Brian Cox, who rejected some complaints but said that scenes of him standing on a mountaintop while a helicopter circled him would not be repeated. Britton is about to launch a new Channel 4 show, while Bleakley said filming Daybreak had put holiday plans on hold.
	
		It's DiCaprio. A photo of Knut was placed on a shot of DiCaprio in Iceland, in May 2007. Two months earlier Knut had graced the German Vanity Fair alone.
	
		It's Manchester, where he was the guest of the British Foundry Workers' Union and was presented with a gold medal.
	
		It's booze. Scotland's head of the prosecution service warned of an "apocalypse" of alcohol-fuelled crime unless the country's hard-drinking culture was curbed.
	
		It's Claire. Phillippa is the name of his wife and they have a daughter called Flo. This photo was at Buckingham Palace in 2004.
	
		It's a VW camper van. Novelist and screen writer Frank Cottrell Boyce was asked by the family of original creator Ian Fleming to pen a sequel.
