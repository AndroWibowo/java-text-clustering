Exit polls from Kazakhstan's controversial presidential election suggest incumbent Nursultan Nazarbayev has won 95% of the vote.

The prediction is based on data from two different organisations, one of which reportedly polled 50,000 voters across the ex-Soviet state.    

Mr Nazarbayev, 70, has been in power for more than 20 years. 

Opponents say they did not have enough time to prepare for the election, called less than two months ago.

But critics say the opposition proved its weakness in having no single strong candidate capable of challenging Mr Nazarbayev.

Under a 2007 constitutional amendment, there is no limit on the number of terms he may serve in office.

Three other candidates stood in Sunday's election: environmentalist Mels Yeleusizov, Gani Kasymov of the Party of Patriots of Kazakhstan, and Zhambyl Akhmetbekov of the Communist People's Party of Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan's Association of Sociologists and Politologists gave Mr Nazarbayev 94.82% of the vote, based on an exit poll of 1.2% of those who voted.

Polling 50,000 voters, the Institute of Democracy gave him 95.1%.

In the 2005 election, Mr Nazarbayev won 91.2%.

Voter turnout was 89.9%, the country's electoral commission said, up from 76.8% at the previous election in 2005.

Campaigning for this poll was low-key - the most organised and visible being by the main pro-presidential party Nur Otan, says the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie in Almaty. 

Mr Nazarbayev has no real competition, she adds. 

No elections in Kazakhstan have ever been judged as free and fair by independent monitors. 

"We have not had fair elections in 20 years," said former Senate member and current human rights leader Zauresh Battalova.

The first official results are expected early on Monday.
