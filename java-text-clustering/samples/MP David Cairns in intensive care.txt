The former Scotland Office minister David Cairns has been taken into intensive care, suffering from acute pancreatitis.

The Inverclyde MP is receiving specialist treatment at University College London Hospitals.

Neighbouring MP Jim Sheridan has taken over Mr Cairns' constituency matters while he is in hospital.

Mr Cairns served in the last UK government, but quit in 2008 after criticising Gordon Brown's leadership.

Acute pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas, is a treatable condition, but has been known to be life-threatening.

In a statement, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: "David Cairns MP has been taken ill with acute pancreatitis.

"Neighbouring MP Jim Sheridan will attend to David's constituency matters while he remains in hospital."
