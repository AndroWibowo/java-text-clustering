                      Nigeria&#039;s three main opposition candidates have pulled out of election debates with President Goodluck Jonathan, accusing him of &quot;arrogance&quot;.
        The three - Nuhu Ribadu, Muhammadu Buhari and Ibrahim Shekarau - are suspicious that he will take part only in a live TV debate largely organised by state-run media.
        A BBC correspondent says the boycott is embarrassing for Mr Jonathan.
        He is favourite to win the 9 April poll in Africa&#039;s biggest oil exporter.
        Mr Jonathan refused to take part in a debate last week, organised by NN24 TV, saying he would participate only in one scheduled for next Tuesday run by the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria.
        His opponents say they are &quot;suspicious&quot; of his relationship with this body, which mostly comprises state-run broadcasters.

	      &quot;He has arrogantly shunned the credible debate for which we made ourselves available,&quot; they said in a joint statement, insisting they had  &quot;bent backwards&quot; to accommodate him.
        The BBC&#039;s Caroline Duffield in Lagos says Mr Jonathan  is a poor public speaker.
        It is clear that his advisers want to shield him from the media as much as possible, she says.
        Mr Jonathan is the candidate of the People&#039;s Democratic Party which has won every national poll since military rule ended in 1999.
        But his candidacy was opposed by some party power-brokers, who say a northerner should have been the party candidate instead of Mr Jonathan, who is from the southern, oil-producing Niger Delta region.
        The former vice-president inherited power last year when President Umaru Yar&#039;Adua died.
        Previous elections have been marred by widespread violence and allegations of fraud.
        Some of the promised electoral reforms have been implemented ahead of next month&#039;s elections but not enough to satisfy the opposition.
        Elections for the National Assembly are due on 2 April.
