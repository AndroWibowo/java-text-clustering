Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz has been honoured with a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. 

The 36-year-old called the unveiling "a very special day that I will always remember".

The ceremony was also attended by Cruz's husband, actor Javier Bardem, and friend and Pirates of the Caribbean co-star Johnny Depp.

Cruz is the first Spanish actress to receive a star, which is located in front of the El Capitan Theatre.

"Every time I look at that star, I will see the names of all the people that have helped me make many of my dreams a reality," Cruz said.

The actress said when she first arrive in the US in 1994, she only knew how to say "How are you?" and "I want to work with Johnny Depp" in English.

The pair later starred together in the 2001 film Blow.

Depp paid tribute to Cruz at the ceremony, describing her as "a magnificent and magical woman", adding it was "a pleasure to be able to be here to celebrate this curious Spanish creature".

Cruz made her acting debut on TV when she was a teenager and began her feature film career in the 1992 movie Jamon Jamon, opposite Bardem.

She went on to star in films including Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Vanilla Sky and Volver and won an Oscar for her performance in Woody Allen's Vicky Christina Barcelona which also starred Bardem.

She will next be seen on screen opposite Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which will be released in the UK in May.
