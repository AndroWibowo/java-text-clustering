                      The future of the Vauxhall plant in Luton has been secured after a decision was made to build the new Vivaro van at the UK site. 
        It had been feared that the site would close in the next few years. 
        The union said the decision, which will safeguard 1,100 jobs, was &quot;fantastic&quot; news. 
        Owner Vauxhall, the UK arm of General Motors, said the site would continue to play an &quot;important role&quot; in its manufacturing network. 
        An existing contract between Vauxhall and French counterpart Renault to use the site had been due to run out in 2013.
        The decision to continue production at Luton comes after the two car companies agreed last September to extend their collaboration on light commercial vehicle manufacturing, which first began in 1996.
        Meanwhile, production of Renault&#039;s new Trafic van - also a product of the two firms&#039; partnership - as well as the high-roof Vivaro will be at Renault&#039;s Sandouille plant in Normandy.
