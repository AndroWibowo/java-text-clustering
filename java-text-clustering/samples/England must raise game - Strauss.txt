	England v Sri Lanka preview





Captain Andrew Strauss said England have &quot;less to fear&quot; as they prepare for the World Cup quarter-final against Sri Lanka on Saturday in Colombo.England reached the knock-out stages after beating West Indies in their final Group B match. &quot;There's less to fear at this stage,&quot; Strauss told BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew. &quot;You're playing good sides so you can't just hang in there and exist. You have to earn the right to win these games.&quot; England could be without seamer Tim Bresnan, who faces a late fitness test on his right calf. Medium pacer Jade Dernbach is ready to step in if the Yorkshire player fails to recover in time. England have already had Kevin Pietersen (hernia), pacemen Stuart Broad (side strain) and Ajmal Shahzad (hamstring) forced out by injuries. Spinner Michael Yardy, who pulled out of the squad on Thursday because of depression, has been replaced by Adil Rashid.

However, the Yorkshire bowler will be unavailable as he travels from the Caribbean to the sub-continent where he has been playing for the second string. England, who for all their struggles have been 
    
         
        
        
            
            rated as one of the favourites by Sunil Gavaskar
            
        
        
    
    



, have not played since their win over West Indies on 17 March and Strauss said the time off has been both beneficial and unwelcome. &quot;We've tried to stay out of sun. There's a lot of stuff in hotel rooms, like computer games,&quot; said Strauss. &quot;It's not ideal to have had this much time off. In one sense it's good, bodies have been able to recover. But mentally you want to get on with it.&quot; Meanwhile, the 1996 champions Sri Lanka will go into the match on their home turf as favourites.

	Swann keen to face 'fantastic' Murali





The co-hosts won four out of their six group games, with defeat by Pakistan their only blip. Their match against Australia was a washout. The battle against England is an intriguing prospect, with Sri Lanka having lost their first five World Cup encounters against their opponents but having won two of the last three, including a two-run victory in the 2007 event. The two teams have faced each other at the Premadasa four times and the home side have won on three occasions. Captain Kumar Sangakkara believes both sides will feel the &quot;intensity&quot; of the occasion. &quot;I don't think the pressure will only be on us,&quot; he said.

&quot;All sides feel the intensity and pressure of a big match with the incentive of a semi-final place involved.&quot; Meanwhile, Sangakkara said that all-time leading one-day wicket-taker Muttiah Muralitharan will be fit for the crunch match. The 38-year-old spinner, who has a world record of 530 one-day wickets, injured his hamstring during Sri Lanka's 112-run win over New Zealand last week, but has since recovered. &quot;Muralitharan is a 100% fit. He is a guy who rises to the occasion and we are confident about what he can do for us in this crucial match,&quot; added the captain. 
    
         
        
        
            
            Batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan told the BBC in his exclusive column
            
        
        
    
    



 that England will fail to cope with Muralitharan and the rest of the Sri Lanka bowlers. &quot;I think we have the best bowling attack in this World Cup and so England are definitely going to struggle against our bowling attack, which includes quality spinners,&quot; he said. &quot;Strauss and Jonathan Trott are in good form but they haven't played against Muralitharan for the last three or four years. And as well as Murali we have Ajantha Mendis and Rangana Herath waiting for a chance to make an impact, while I am also happy with my own bowling.&quot; Sri Lanka (from): Sangakkara (capt), Jayawardene, Tharanga, Dilshan, Samaraweera, Silva, Kapugedera, Mathews, Perera, Kulasekara, Malinga, Fernando, Muralitharan, Mendis, Herath. England (from): Strauss (capt), Morgan, Trott, Bell, Collingwood, Bopara, Prior, Bresnan, Swann, Anderson, Dernbach, Tredwell, Wright, Tremlett. Umpires: Billy Doctrove (WIS) and Simon Taufel (AUS) TV umpire: Tony Hill (NZL) Match referee: Jeff Crowe (NZL)
