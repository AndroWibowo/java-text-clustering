A new appeal for help to find Bath university student James Bubear has been made by a second MP.

The 19-year-old from Llandrindod Wells, Powys, was last seen on 13 March, when he had a night out with friends in the Somerset town.

Brecon and Radnorshire MP Roger Williams, whose constituency includes his home town, asked anyone with any information to come forward urgently.

Bath MP Don Foster also made an appeal for information on Tuesday.

Mr Bubear was last seen leaving a fancy dress party at the Revolution bar in George Street, Bath, on 13 March.

CCTV captured the Bath Spa University student walking along James Street West, outside the Odeon cinema. 

On Monday, police revealed that a woman who was seen talking to him outside the cinema had come forward. 

After the young woman left, Mr Bubear had sat down in a doorway nearby.

Mr Williams said: "The Bubear family are obviously very concerned about James's location and are keen to find him as soon as possible.

"Anyone with information about James's potential whereabouts, no matter how insignificant they feel that information may be, should come forward as a matter of urgency."

Mr Bubear's mobile phone and passport were found in a city centre doorway by a street cleaner on 14 March, but there have been no sightings of him since he was spotted on CCTV on the night he disappeared.

Police have searched the River Avon and routes Mr Bubear might have walked on the way to his student flat on the Lower Bristol Road, but no trace of him has yet been found.

At the weekend members of his family and friends joined a march to highlight his disappearance.

More than 11,000 people have signed up to a campaign on Facebook to try to find Mr Bubear.
