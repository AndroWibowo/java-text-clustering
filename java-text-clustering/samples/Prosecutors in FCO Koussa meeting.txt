Scottish prosecutors and police officers are to meet Foreign Office officials to discuss access to ex-Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa.

The Crown Office said it had been in close contact with the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) this week.

It has already requested an interview with Mr Koussa in connection with the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.

Mr Koussa arrived in the UK on Wednesday saying he was no longer willing to represent the Libyan regime.

A Crown Office spokesperson said: "I can confirm that representatives of the Crown Office and Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary have been in close contact with FCO officials over recent days and will be meeting with them on Monday to discuss the situation concerning Mr Moussa Koussa further."

Mr Koussa is continuing to be questioned by intelligence and diplomatic officials, since claiming to have fled from Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime.

In the 1980s Mr Koussa was a leading member of the Libyan Bureau for External Security (the Mathaba) which has been linked to the Lockerbie bombing.

Lockerbie investigation

A total of 270 people died when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie in December 1988.

Libyan Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi's remains the only man convicted of the atrocity. 

Speaking on the BBC's Politics Show Scotland, Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said he hoped Mr Koussa might provide the Crown and police with new leads for the Lockerbie bombing investigation.

"Obviously everybody accepts that this tragedy that happened was not carried out by one man alone - there has been a live file and ongoing investigation," he said.

"What this will lead to I don't know, but I think everybody accepts that the Crown and police investigation in Scotland has been thorough, diligent and carried out fairly and appropriately.

"So I hope it will provide some greater leads. But that is a matter for the appropriate bodies and that's the prosecutors."
