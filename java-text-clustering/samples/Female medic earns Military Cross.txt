A British army medic who put herself in "mortal danger" to treat a wounded Afghan soldier under heavy Taliban fire has been awarded the Military Cross.

L/Cpl Kylie Watson, from Ballymena, Co Antrim, gave medical care in exposed open ground for 20 minutes.

Her citation spoke of her "immense courage" and described her as an "inspiration" to her platoon.

L/Cpl Watson is believed to be only the fourth woman to receive the MC, the third highest award for gallantry.

On another occasion L/Cpl Watson, of the Royal Army Medical Corps, ran 100 metres in full view of the enemy under sustained fire to give life-saving first aid to an Afghan soldier who had been shot twice in the pelvis.

Her citation read: "Watson's immense courage, willingness to put her own life at risk and absolute bravery saved the life of one warrior and acted as an inspiration to her platoon and their Afghan National Army partners."

Royal Marine Mark Jackson has been been awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross after he picked up and threw back an enemy grenade before lying on a comrade to shield him from the blast.

The incident happened when Marine Jackson was on look-out duty at a remote patrol base in Afghanistan's Helmand province on 24 August last year.

His medal citation said: "Improvised grenades such as these are notoriously volatile and this one could have detonated at any moment.

"Jackson was well aware of the risk, his only thought was for the life of his comrade who, had he hesitated for one moment, would have been killed."

L/Cpl Watson and Marine Jackson are among 136 service personnel, most of whom served in Afghanistan with 4 Mechanised Brigade between April and October last year, to be named in the latest military honours list.

They will be presented with their awards at a later date.
