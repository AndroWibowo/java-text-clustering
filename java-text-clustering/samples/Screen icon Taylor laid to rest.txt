											Screen icon Elizabeth Taylor dies
											Obituary: Elizabeth Taylor
								
	
                      Dame Elizabeth Taylor has been buried in a cemetery just outside Los Angeles, a day after her death.
        Her private funeral was held at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.
        Pop icon Michael Jackson, a friend of Taylor&#039;s, is one of a number of stars also buried at the cemetery.
        Taylor, one of the 20th Century&#039;s biggest movie stars, died in Los Angeles on Wednesday of congestive heart failure. She was 79. 
        Her funeral service started 15 minutes late, at the star&#039;s request. 
        &quot;Miss Taylor had left instructions that it was to begin at least 15 minutes later than publicly scheduled, with the announcement: &#039;She even wanted to be late for her own funeral&#039;,&quot; said a statement from her publicist.
  'Soaring angel'
	      The hour-long service included a recital of the Gerard Manley Hopkins&#039; poem The Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo and a trumpet solo of Amazing Grace, performed by Taylor&#039;s grandson Rhys.
  
  

    Burton and Taylor appeared together in Private Lives in 1983
  
      &quot;The casket was closed and draped with a blanket of abundant, fragrant gardenias, violets and lily of the valley,&quot; it said.
        &quot;Miss Taylor was interred in the Great Mausoleum, sheltered beneath a soaring marble Michelangelo angel.&quot;
        About four dozen family members attended the funeral, which was presided over by a rabbi.
        On Friday Broadway theatres will dim their lights for a minute at 2000 local time - the traditional curtain time for shows - in tribute to the actress.
        The Broadway League said the star, who won a Tony Award nomination for a 1981 revival of The Little Foxes, &quot;lit up the Broadway stage the same way she lit up the silver screen&quot;.
        She returned to Broadway in 1983 in Noel Coward&#039;s Private Lives, in which she appeared opposite Richard Burton.
        Taylor&#039;s famous films included National Velvet, Cleopatra and Who&#039;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
        She was equally well-known for her glamour and film partnership with Burton, one of her seven husbands.
        The peak of her film career came in the 1950s and 1960s, with four Oscar nominations in a row from 1958 to 1961.
        Taylor&#039;s Hollywood contemporaries have been paying tribute to her as an actress, friend and activist.
