A man has been arrested following an armed siege at a house in Blackpool.

Police went to a house on Queen Victoria Road on Saturday night to arrest a man on behalf of officers in Scotland.

He was wanted on suspicion of attempted murder and wounding with intent, but he locked himself in with his partner and child.

A 25-year-old man, from Greenock, Inverclyde, was arrested at 1015 BST on suspicion of false imprisonment.

Armed officers were sent to the scene as it was believed the man inside had a weapon.

A specially-trained negotiator was called to the scene and a man then left the property and was arrested.

He was taken to Blackpool police station where he will be held before being transferred to Scotland.

Ch Insp Karen Simister, of Lancashire police said: "This was a lengthy and protracted incident that reached a safe conclusion just after 10am this morning following the hard work and patience of specially trained officers.

"There was a lot of police activity in and around the scene and we stopped some people from returning to their property and also prevented someone from leaving their home. 

"These decisions were based on protecting the public and minimising the risk. I would like to thank people in the area for their cooperation, patience and support.

"Incidents like this are rare but when they do happen the public should be reassured that Lancashire Constabulary has highly trained officers that will deal with the situation."
