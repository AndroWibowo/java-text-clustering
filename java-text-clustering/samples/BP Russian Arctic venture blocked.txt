                      Russian shareholders of TNK-BP have blocked BP&#039;s Arctic exploration deal with state-owned Rosneft.
        &quot;We won,&quot; said a spokesman for the oil joint venture&#039;s Russian shareholders.
        A Swedish arbitration panel in London agreed that the Arctic deal violated a previous agreement between them and BP made when they set up TNK-BP.
        BP said it was disappointed at the decision, and hoped it could still go ahead with a share swap agreed with Rosneft as part of the deal.
        &quot;BP looks forward to finding a way to resolve its differences with its Russian partners to allow these important Arctic developments to proceed in future,&quot; said the UK oil firm in a statement on the arbitration panel&#039;s decision.
        However, the UK firm faces an effective deadline for breaking the deadlock of 14 April, according to the BBC&#039;s business editor, Robert Peston.
        That is the date on which BP&#039;s agreement with Rosneft must be consummated by, or else it will expire.

	      The oil giant signed the controversial new deal with its Russian state-owned counterpart in January, in order to exploit potentially huge deposits of oil and gas in Russia&#039;s Arctic shelf.
        But TNK-BP&#039;s Russian shareholders claimed BP broke an agreement to inform them of any other Russian oil business deals.
        The &quot;strategic global alliance&quot; with Rosneft would have seen the UK and Russian firms exchange expertise in exploring the region.
        As part of the deal, the pair had agreed that Rosneft would take 5% of BP&#039;s shares in exchange for approximately 9.5% of Rosneft&#039;s shares.
        It is this share exchange that is said to have particularly upset TNK-BP&#039;s Russian shareholders.

			Siberia&#039;s oil frontier
		
	      The Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR) consortium, which represents the Russian shareholders, won a High Court injunction in London last month that put the BP-Rosneft deal on hold until the dispute could be resolved by arbitration.
        It was hoped that the joint venture might be given a role in the Arctic exploration deal, but TNK-BP&#039;s shareholders failed to agree on this.
        The arbitration panel has now ruled that the temporary injunction &quot;should continue&quot; according to BP.
        &quot;Wilfully ignoring the provisions of the shareholder agreement was a serious misjudgement by BP that has severely damaged the relationship between the TNK-BP shareholders,&quot; said Stan Polovets, chief executive of AAR.
        &quot;It has also harmed BP&#039;s reputation in Russia,&quot; he added. &quot;We expect [BP chief executive] Bob Dudley to make every effort to rectify the situation and rebuild the trust that has been lost between BP, AAR and the management of TNK-BP.&quot;
