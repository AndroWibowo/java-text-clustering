                      Stamp collecting specialist Stanley Gibbons has reported a rise in profits thanks to higher sales to rich customers, many of whom live in China.
        Pre-tax profits for the full year 2010 came in at £4.5m, up 8% from 2009. Revenue grew by 13% to £26.4m.
        The firm said it expected China to become a key growth market in the coming years.
        It said it was also looking at opening new investment offices in Hong Kong and Switzerland.
        &quot;The strong performance of the group in 2010 and a positive start to 2011 is a result of the enduring strength of the market of collectables,&quot; said chairman Martin Bralsford.
        He said &quot;persistent political and economic turmoil&quot; meant the market was particularly attractive compared with the low rates of return currently offered by some other asset classes.
        Stamps had produced returns of 10% on average over the past 50 years, he said.
        Stanley Gibbons was founded in 1856 and the stamp business received a Royal warrant in 1914. 
        It later established an auction house and expanded its business to include other rare collectors&#039; items.
