Canadian authorities have arrested a man accused of seeking to travel to Somalia to join a militant group.

The man, whose name was not immediately released, was stopped at Toronto Pearson airport on Tuesday, Canadian police said in a statement.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said he was bound for Cairo, then Somalia.

He planned to join al-Shabab, which the US and Canada consider a terror group, and "participate in their terrorist activities", police said.

The man was charged under federal law with attempting to participate in terrorist activity and with providing counsel to a person to participate in such activity, police said.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said he would be identified when charges are formally laid in court on Wednesday.

Anti-terror police began investigating him in October, and arrested him without incident after learning he planned to travel to Somali to link up with al-Shabab, police said.

"The RCMP plays a critical role in the fight against global terrorism, and this investigation is an example of our dedication to this important cause," Inspector Keith Finn said. 

"We will continue to work with partners to eliminate terrorist criminal activity in Canada and abroad."
