A grandmother has told an inquest her daughter should never have been resuscitated after being pulled from a house fire which killed her children.

Maddie Hudson, three, Anthony Hudson, five, and William Beale, nine, died in the fire in Bridlington on 11 November.

Their mother, Samantha Hudson, was starved of oxygen but survived.

The children's grandmother, Susan Hudson, told Hull Coroner's Court that her daughter now had "no quality of life".

Paramedic Simon Leeson fought back tears as he told the court that he was the first on the scene and he decided to work on the 27-year-old mother as she was showing signs of life.

After he gave evidence, Susan Hudson asked him: "How long was she starved of oxygen?

"She will never be Samantha again. It just seems to me Samantha should never have been brought back."

Humberside Fire and Rescue Service investigators said they believed the most likely cause of the fire was a cigarette which had not been fully extinguished.

Police had said there was nothing to indicate the fire was started deliberately.

Mrs Hudson described the young victims as a happy and well-loved.

She described William as a "loving and cuddly boy", while Antony, known as AJ, was described as a "tough little lad who stuck up for his elder brother".

Maddie liked to dress up but enjoyed the "rough and tumble" with her brothers, the court was told.

Their mother spent months in hospital before being moved to a rehabilitation centre near Goole where she continues to receive treatment. 

She was unable to attend the funeral of her children.

The inquest is expected to conclude on Thursday.
