	A tour of the Scottish Parliament





The campaign for devolution in Scotland culminated in 1999, with the establishment of a Scottish Parliament.In the three centuries since the Treaty of Union, discontent - to put it mildly - was expressed at being governed from London. The Scotland Act of 1998 paved the way for the creation of a Scottish Parliament capable of passing laws affecting Scotland on a range of issues, known as devolved matters. The powers given to the Parliament include the ability to raise or lower the basic rate of income tax by up to three pence in the pound - an option unused so far by Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). DistinctThe Scottish Parliament scrutinises and monitors the devolved Scottish Government and makes laws for Scotland. Although government ministers are drawn from the Parliament, the two institutions are legally separate and have their own distinct roles. The Scottish Parliament's devolved powers are not supreme and ultimately are only granted at the discretion of the Westminster Parliament. Some areas remain the preserve of the UK Parliament - and Scotland remains part of the UK. Nevertheless, decisions over vital areas like health, education and housing are now made in Scotland. Devolution was intended to bring a new politics to Scotland. By relocating decision-making closer to the people of Scotland, the aim was to increase access to the democratic process and as a result, raise the accountability of those elected to the Parliament. Has devolution succeeded? That remains a matter of opinion - and the subject of fierce debate. Even the Parliament building at Holyrood has proved

, including one from Sir Walter Scott's Heart of Midlothian. It reads: &quot;When we had a king, and a chancellor, and parliament-men o' our ain, we could aye peeble them wi' stanes when they werena gude bairns.&quot; Scott's words serve as a reminder to MSPs that they are firmly back in the heartland of Scotland, surrounded by their electorate, the people of Scotland.
