                      The European Union (EU) should offer Japan a free trade deal to help it recover from the earthquake and tsunami two weeks ago, UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said.
        &quot;One of our priorities must be to invite Japan to enter into a free trade area with the EU,&quot; Mr Cameron said. 
        This would give Japan a trade boost and aid its economic recovery, he said following an EU summit in Brussels.
        The Japanese government has estimated the rebuilding cost to be £192bn.
        Mr Cameron said he had &quot;secured a specific reference&quot; to his proposal in the conclusions of EU documents.
        The documents will be published later.
  Manageable costs
	      Earlier, the International Monetary Fund said it believed Japan&#039;s economy was strong enough to afford the cost of rebuilding the damage from the earthquake and tsunami.
        It said it expected a short-term drop in the economy, but no long-term impact.
        &quot;Despite the extensive damage we are of the view that the economic costs are manageable,&quot; said Ken Kang, the IMF&#039;s Asia Pacific chief. 
        However, it said that power shutdowns would complicate Japan&#039;s prospects.
