Tottenham Hotspur Football Club has returned to profit thanks to its success in Europe this season.

The club made pre-tax profits of ?4.2m ($6.76m) during the last six months of 2010, up from a loss of ?8.3m over the same period the previous year.

Turnover increased 49% to ?79m.

"Our first-half figures reflect a strong performance, buoyed by the contribution from our participation in the Uefa Champions League," said chairman Daniel Levy. 

Tottenham's operating expenses rose to ?61.5m, up from ?48.6m, due primarily to the costs associated with having a larger squad. 

But in the club's half-yearly report it said this was off-set by the "significant increase in revenue" the club brought in from its campaign in Europe this season.

It said merchandise sales increased by 22% and sponsorship and corporate hospitality revenue grew from ?12.7m to ?16m.

Spurs returned to Europe's elite competition for the 2010-11 season, having waited 48 years. 

The club qualified for the Champions League by finishing fourth in the English Premier League last season. 

It faces Real Madrid in the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
