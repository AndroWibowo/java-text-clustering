A newspaper seller who died at the G20 protest did not appear to be "agitated" before he was shoved to the ground by a police officer, an inquest has heard.

The 47-year-old newspaper seller looked "fairly calm" as he appeared in front of a line of police in the City of London, IT worker Warren Cameron said.

Another witness told the hearing Mr Tomlinson, who was not involved in the demonstration, appeared "wasted".

New footage of Mr Tomlinson's last moments in April 2009 was shown.

The images came from CCTV, police helicopter footage and video recordings taken by members of the public.

Mr Cameron described what he saw as police attempted to usher Mr Tomlinson away from a cordon.

City worker James Stone told the inquest he also spotted Mr Tomlinson in front of the police.

"I saw Mr Tomlinson and thought to myself, 'Boy, does he look wasted'," he said.

"He was looking back towards the police and bank. I remember that Mr Tomlinson had his arms to his side with a very out-of-it expression on his face."

On the first day of the inquest on Tuesday, a former police officer said Mr Tomlinson appeared "very drunk" although a colleague who gave evidence disputed this.

Video footage shown at the inquest, being held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in Fleet Street, captured the newspaper seller as he attempted to make his way home through the demonstration. 

Wearing a Millwall Football Club T-shirt, Mr Tomlinson appeared to gesture to police after getting up from the ground after being shoved. Then he was seen walking unsteadily before collapsing in nearby Cornhill.

The hearing continues.
