                      Two soldiers from 1st Battalion Irish Guards killed in Afghanistan just six days before they were due to return home have been named.
        Maj Matthew Collins, 38, from Backwell, in Somerset, and L/Sgt Mark Burgan, 28, from Liverpool, died on Wednesday when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb.
        Their commanding officer said their loss was &quot;a devastating blow&quot;.
        Their deaths take to 362 the total number of UK military personnel to have died in Afghanistan since 2001.
        Maj Collins joined 1st Battalion Irish Guards and had also served in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Northern Ireland and Iraq.
        He was the company commander of Number 3 Company.
        His family said in a statement: &quot;Not only a soldier but a caring husband, devoted father to Freya and Charlie, caring son, wonderful brother and friend to many. We will all miss him and remember him always.&quot; 
        L/Sgt Burgan joined the Guards in 1999 and had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq. 
        His wife, Leanne, said: &quot;I am so honoured to be Mark&#039;s wife. I will always love my hero.
        &quot;Mark was an extremely proud Irish Guardsman, dad, husband, brother and son. He will forever be in our hearts.&quot;
