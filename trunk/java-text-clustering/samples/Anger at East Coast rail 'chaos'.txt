Train passengers left stranded by signalling problems on the East Coast main line have complained of being left to fend for themselves.

Many people were eventually brought to York station after being stuck on trains for hours.

Middlesbrough passenger Mike Oyston said: "It was just chaos, there was no information at all."

A spokesman for train operator East Coast said: "We sincerely apologise for the queues and inconvenience."

He said the company had tried to keep passengers informed by sending members of staff to York station.

"Part of the problem was that we didn't know the exact times when this situation would be resolved so the amount of information we had was limited," he said.

"Clearly we had a difficult weekend." 

However, passengers would be eligible for compensation payments under its '"delay repay" scheme. 

Most of East Coast's services were operating normally on Sunday, he added.

However, Mr Oyston said he was angry that he had to arrange for a friend to drive to York from Middlesbrough to take him home.

"There were about 1,000 people waiting to get home from York station," he said.

"We were not told anything. We were directed to the back car park and left to get on with it. We're not happy at all."

Grandmother Pat Feetham, of Hull, also complained of a lack of information after being stuck on a train from Scotland for almost five hours.

"They ran out of food, it was very cold and we didn't know what was happening until a police officer got on the train and said there were buses to take us to York. We're not happy."

As delays continued on some services on Sunday, National Rail Enquiries said a number of train crews and trains were not in the right place to run. It advised people to check before travelling.
