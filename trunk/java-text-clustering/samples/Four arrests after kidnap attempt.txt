Two men, aged 20 and 21, and two women have been arrested following a kidnapping incident in Bangor, County Down, on Saturday.

Police said four people abducted a man in his mid-20s as he came out of a hostel in the town's Central Avenue area at 1700 BST.

He was tied up and bundled into a dark-coloured Fiesta car but escaped shortly afterwards at Skipperstown Road.

The man received minor injuries and was shocked by his ordeal.
