On 18 September 1997, the people of Wales voted in a referendum on devolution.They may have voted yes, but it was by the thinnest of margins - 50.3% to 49.7%. Nevertheless, a new dawn had broken, as the then-Welsh Secretary Ron Davies claimed. Although wheels were set in motion for a National Assembly for Wales, those in favour had a huge task to convince those who had voted against it - and those who hadn't voted at all - that it would benefit the country. However Mr Davies also said: &quot;Devolution is a process, not an event.&quot; Laws from scratchThat proved to be the case. The Government of Wales Act 1998 established the Assembly but it wasn't until a second act in 2006 that it gained the ability to make its own laws from scratch rather than adapting legislation created in Westminster. However, the Assembly still has to ask MPs for permission to legislate in some areas - though not for much longer. In a referendum on 3 March 2011, voters in Wales decided that the Assembly be able to pass laws on devolved issues without first having to ask Westminster. The new legislative system will come into force from the beginning of the fourth Assembly. The current legislative process has led to bickering between Cardiff Bay and Westminster over the finer details of certain requests for the power to legislate. Two areas which have seen a tug-of-war along the M4 have been the issue of the Welsh language and affordable housing. The Assembly prides itself on avoiding the &quot;yah-boo&quot; politics of Westminster. And although chamber sessions do get heated from time to time, the Presiding Officer insists on limiting the shouting and jeering heard all too often on the floor of the Commons. He has even been known to switch off an AM's microphone if comments get too long-winded. The
