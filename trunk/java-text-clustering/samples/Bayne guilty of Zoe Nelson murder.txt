                      A man is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of murdering 17-year-old Zoe Nelson and burning her body in woods in North Lanarkshire.
        Robert Bayne, 21, attacked the teenager with a knife, put a plastic sheet over her face and set her on fire, near Cambusnethan, Wishaw, in May last year. 
        He was also found guilty of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
        Bayne had to be physically restrained as the jury delivered their unanimous verdict at the High Court in Edinburgh. 
        The handcuffed bodybuilder jumped up in the dock and began struggling violently with security officers and police - headbutting one of them
        He also shouted insults and threats at Zoe Nelson&#039;s family, forcing the court to be cleared while officers restored order. 
        Judge Lady Dorrian will tell Bayne later how long he must serve in prison.
        Motherwell College student Zoe, who was said to have been in a relationship with Bayne, was seen leaving her Newmains home at 1700 BST on 22 May 2010.
        She was later seen on CCTV footage in a local store at about 1730 BST.
        Residents reported seeing a fire in woods, known as Monkey Hill, later that evening.
        A member of the public found her badly burned body there the following day 
        During the trial, the jury heard how Bayne, from Cambusnethan, took Zoe&#039;s sister Laura Anne to Monkey Hill and showed her the body.
        A police tape was played in court in which Bayne could be heard threatening to &quot;lamp&quot; a detective who was questioning him.
        The prosecution also presented evidence which showed that traces of DNA found on Zoe&#039;s remains matched samples taken from Bayne.
