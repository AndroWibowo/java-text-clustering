Author John Le Carre has asked judges to withdraw his name from the Man Booker International Prize shortlist saying he does not wish to take part.

The British thriller writer said he was "enormously flattered" but added: "I do not compete for literary prizes."

But chief judge Rick Gekoski said he and his panel were "great admirers" of Le Carre and that his name would, "of course, remain on the list".

Philip Pullman and Rohinton Mistry are also up for the £60,000 biennial award.

The list features 13 writers from eight countries including China, which is represented - by 2009 Man Asian Literary Prize winner Su Tong - for the first time.

The winner of the prize, which is awarded to a living author whose work has been published in English or widely translated into English, will be announced at the Sydney Writers' Festival in Australia on 18 May.

Mr Gekoski said the list was "diverse, fresh and thought-provoking".

Le Carre's novels include The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, The Tailor of Panama and The Constant Gardener.

Pullman is best known for His Dark Materials trilogy, which has won numerous prizes including the Carnegie Medal. 

The winner is chosen solely by the judging panel - there are no submissions from publishers.

Ismail Kadare won the inaugural prize in 2005, followed by Chinua Achebe in 2007 and Alice Munro in 2009.

An awards ceremony will take place for this year's recipient in London on 28 June.
