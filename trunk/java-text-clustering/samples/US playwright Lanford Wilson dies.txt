    Wilson was a prominent member of the Off-Broadway theatre scene
  
                      Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Lanford Wilson, best known for such plays as Talley&#039;s Folly and Burn This, has died aged 73.
        The writer passed away at a New Jersey hospital on Wednesday after a long illness, his agent said.
        Wilson wrote 17 full-length plays and more than 30 one-acts.
        He was awarded the Pulitzer in 1980 for Talley&#039;s Folly, part of a trilogy of plays about several generations of a Missouri family.
        He died on the eve of a new staging of his 1973 work The Hot L Baltimore at Chicago&#039;s Steppenwolf theatre.
        Tina Landau, the play&#039;s director, said Wilson&#039;s &quot;tremendous spirit is with us in the theatre&quot; and that Thursday&#039;s performance would be in his honour.
        The writer was a prominent member of the Off-Broadway theatre scene and was one of four founders of The Circle Repertory Company in New York.
        Marshall W Mason. a friend and collaborator, posted a notice on Facebook saying Wilson&#039;s death was &quot;a peaceful, painless end&quot;.
        &quot;Words cannot express the loss we all will feel,&quot; he added. &quot;But we must be grateful for the bountiful beauty he bestowed upon us.&quot;
        Lanford&#039;s Burn This was staged in London in 1990 with John Malkovich and Juliet Stevenson.
