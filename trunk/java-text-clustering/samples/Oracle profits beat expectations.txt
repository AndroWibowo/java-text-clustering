                      US software-maker Oracle&#039;s shares jump more than 2% after it reported better-than-expected earnings in the last three months of the year.
        The company reported a 37% jump in revenues to $8.8bn (£5.5bn), with net income rising 78%.
        Oracle also set out a forecast for the current quarter ahead of most estimates and raised its dividend payment to shareholders by 20%.
        Oracle is closely watched by analysts for trends in the technology industry.
        New software license sales, which are a good gauge of future profits, jumped 29% to $2.2bn in the third quarter.
        Oracle made net income for the quarter of $2.1bn up from $1.2bn a year earlier.
        The company is in a battle with rivals IBM, Cisco Systems and HP to provide infrastructure for companies to move to &quot;cloud computing&quot; - the remote storage and handling of data.
        Last year, Oracle diversified into server hardware with the purchase of Sun Microsystems.
        Japan provides 5% of the company&#039;s revenues but Oracle executives told analysts they saw no material impact from the disruptions to production caused by the earthquake and tsunami.
